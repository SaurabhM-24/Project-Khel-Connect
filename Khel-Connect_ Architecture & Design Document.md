## 5. Security, Error Handling & Scalability

### Security
- Role-based access (athletes write-only, scouts read-only).  
- Firebase Security Rules for strict access control.  
- HTTPS and encrypted storage.  

### Error Handling
- Upload failure: mark as `failed` in Firestore.  
- AI error: set status `failed`, log details.  
- Database write failure: retry mechanism.  

### Scalability
- Cloud Functions auto-scale with load.  
- Modular AI pipelines: easy to extend to multiple sports.  
- Firestore indexes: optimized queries for leaderboards.
