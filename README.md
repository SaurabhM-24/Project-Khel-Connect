Khel-Connect: AI-Powered Platform for Democratizing Sports Talentüåü 

Project Overview
Khel-Connect is an AI-powered mobile and web platform designed to bridge the gap between undiscovered grassroots sporting talent and official scouting infrastructure in India. Our mission is to create a digital meritocracy for Indian sports, where an athlete's skill, not their background or location, determines their future.

The platform functions as a "LinkedIn for aspiring athletes," allowing them to create a digital portfolio and showcase their skills. Our core innovation is the AI Talent Scout, a feature that uses computer vision to analyze a player's performance from a simple video clip and provides an objective "Skill Score." This data feeds into a centralized dashboard for sports authorities, creating a new, unbiased channel for talent identification.

This project was developed for the SIH 2025 (Problem Statement: SIH25073 - Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports).


‚ú® Key Features
* AI Talent Scout: The flagship feature that analyzes user-uploaded video clips of a specific sports action (e.g., a cricket bowl) and generates a quantified Skill Score based on key metrics like body posture, arm angle, and speed.
* Player Profiles: A digital sports portfolio where athletes can track their progress, view their Skill Scores, and maintain a showcase of their performance clips.
* Leaderboards: Dynamic, region-specific leaderboards that rank players based on their Skill Scores, promoting healthy competition and providing visibility to sports authorities.
* Scout Dashboard: A web portal for authenticated sports authorities to view and filter top-ranked players, analyze their profiles, and initiate the scouting process.
